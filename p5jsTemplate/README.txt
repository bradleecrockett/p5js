***
This is simply a Template to use for your p5js labs.
***
The first thing you should do is clone the repo to your own repository.
Add your First and Last Name.
When you are ready to start a lab, fork that repository and use find ad replace to change the p5jsTemplate to the title of the lab.
Then add the date and period as well as a description to the .html file.
Once that is done, move on the the index.js file to actually start the js coding.
